# Template installation instructions

Feel free to drop these below template run and installation instructions into your own project's README and tweak according to your needs.

## Running (EVERY time you return to project – after you have already set things up (see below))

### Start expresss server

1. In the terminal run:

```
npm start
```

Don't kill it; let it run.

### Start frontend dev server

2. In a fresh, second terminal run:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

Don't kill it; let it run.

### Run mysql

3. In a third terminal run:

```
mysql -u root -p
<enter your mysql password>
USE <db name (it's in the model/database.js file)>;
```

Or if you already have set up mysql so you skip entering password:

```
mysql
USE <db name (it's in the model/database.js file)>;
```

Now you are free to run your queries, such as:

```
SHOW tables;
SELECT * FROM <tablename>;
DESC <tablename>;
```

Fin! You are done! Now get developing!

## Setting up repository on machine

## Setting up project (just the first time)

### Open project in VSCode
